# Wikipedia Viewer

The purpose of the project is to provide a Wikipedia Viewer.  It has a random Wikipedia Entry
as well as searching Wikipedia Entries (e.g. Computing Terms such as Cell).

## UX

Wikipedia Viewer allows you to generate a random Wikipedia Entry as well as searching for Wikipedia Entries (e.g.
Computing Terms such as Cell).

When hovering over the Search Icon (Magnifying Glass), a screentip appears.  The color changes.  Clicking on the
magnifying glass takes you to the search form, where you have to enter an item (e.g. torch), term or keyword and then
click on the search button.  The item, term or keyword has the data type of string.

When hovering over the Link, the color changes.

As a user, I can search Wikipedia Entries in the search box and see the resulting Wikipedia Entries.

As a user, I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia Entry.
